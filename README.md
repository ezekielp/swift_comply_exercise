# SwiftComply Data Conversion Script
## Ezekiel Pfeifer, December 2020

### Script language: Python 3

To run the script, open a terminal at the root of this project and use the command `python facilityXmlToCsv.py`. The script should create a `.csv` file with headers matching the `properties.csv` file format from the `SC Backflow CSV Import Examples` folder on Google Drive and data from the `Facility.xml` file.
